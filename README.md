> A stacked bar chart showing Tan's R4DS Slack Community messages each month since he joined in Feb 2020, highlighting messages across help, book club, and other channels. It also annotates some life events over the pandemic, including Advanced R book club from April - August 2020, releasing ffscrapr in August 2020, R packages book club in Sep-Dec 2020, Advent of Code in Dec 2020, starting Twitch streaming in March 2021, suffering lockdown depression in April 2021, and releasing ffsimulator in July 2021

Plot code, as found in my Twitter post here: https://twitter.com/_TanHo/status/1426194122038251520?s=20

Wrangling code won't run without the raw data, which is gitignored - you can get similar data from the Slack API via slackr/slackteams pkgs, I used admin data export here.

Plot uses my personal package, [tantastic](https://github.com/tanho63/tantastic).
